You and I cannot hide
The love we feel inside
The words we need to say

I feel that I have always walked alone
But now that you're here with me
There'll always be a place that I can go

And suddenly our destiny has started to unfold
When you're next to me I can see
The greatest story love has ever told

Now my life is blessed with the love of an angel
How can it be true?
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you

I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
But when we touch, I realize
That I found my place in heaven by your side

I could fly, when you smile
I'd walk a thousand miles
To hear you call my name

Now that I have finally found the one
Who will be there for me
Eternally my everlasting sun

Suddenly our destiny has started to unfold
When you're next to me I can see
The greatest story love has ever told

Now my life is blessed with the love of an angel
How can it be true?
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you

I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
But when we touch, I realize
That I found my place in heaven by your side
That I found my place in heaven by your side

Heaven by your side
Heaven by your side
Heaven by your side

And when your next to me I can see
The greatest story love has ever told

Now my life is blessed with the love of an angel
How can it be true?
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you

I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
But when we touch, I realize
That I found my place in heaven by your side

Now my life is blessed with the love of an angel
Heaven by your side
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you

I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
But when we touch, I realize
That I found my place in heaven by your side
